# Smart Homes Data Visualization
# Introduction

The purpose of this assignment is to evaluate your full stack application development skills. Principles and best practices of front end design, responsive components, DRY, client server model, git-flow, user experience, and page performance will all be tested.

In a project such as this we want you to focus on the things that matter. Code structure, architecture, design patterns, and overall approach is more important than having a great custom webpack configuration. Focus on the main platform features.

Please spend time creating a simple and elegant solution rather than fighting with a framework or library!

## Timeline

The suggested time to complete this challenge is ~8 hours. Upon receiving the challenge you will have three days to make a final submission.

## Problem Definition

Vivid Theory is in need of a simple dashboard for visualizing electrical consumption for a group of homes.

## Data

We have a dataset that includes information collected from multiple smart home electricity monitoring devices. Data is sampled at one minute intervals and contains the following factors:

| Factor           | Units  |                   Explanation |
| ---------------- | :----: | ----------------------------: |
| Serial_Number    | string |                 Unique device |
| DateTime         |  date  |             Date of recording |
| Device_ID        | string |           Instrumented device |
| Device_Name      | string |     User assigned device name |
| User_Device_Name | string |          Detected device type |
| Device_Type      | string | User assigned device category |
| Device_Make      | string |             Manufacturer name |
| Device_Model     | string |       Manufacturer model name |
| Device_Location  | string |          Location within home |
| Wattage          | number |       Sampled wattage reading |

**note**
This is a real dataset. It may contain missing or invalid entries.

### Factor Explanation

- Device_ID
  - main: Main electrical panel within home
  - always_on: Wattage attributed to consistent electrical consumption within the home

Factors of importance are Serial_Number, Device_ID, and wattage. Serial_Number represents a unique device placed within a household. Wattage is monitored at the Device_ID level within the home.

Data can be accessed in the `readings` table at:

`In .env file`

## Business Requirements

Implement a responsive line chart that depicts electrical consumption within the home. Your UI should have the following components

- Line chart

  - Horizontal axis shows the time
  - Vertical axis shows wattage

- Combo box or drop down for Serial_Number

  - The user should be able to either view all data aggregated or filter by specific Serial_Number

- Combo box or drop down for Device_ID
  - As a secondary filter the user should be able to view data or filter to a specific Device_ID
  - Ensure that this filter works appropriately with the Serial_Number filter

## Technical Requirements

Construct a client server application that fulfils the business requirements. Both the client and server should be written in typescript.

### Stack

- Front End
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
    - [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
  - [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- Back End
  - Framework
    - [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/)
    - [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/)
  - ORM
    - [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)
    - or [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/)
    - or no ORM
- Database
  - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) Provided

#### Acceptable alternatives

- REST over GraphQL
- Express (or any other TS backend framework) over Nest.js
- Any charting library or framework

## Important Considerations

- Performance
  - You are not allowed to load all database rows into the browser at once. Your program should query and load data as needed.
- Patterns
  - Employ reusable/dry principles. Use OOP/Functional patterns as necessary.
- Deployment
  - Provide clear instructions on how to start your project in both a development and production setting
